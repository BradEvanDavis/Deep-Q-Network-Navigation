# Deep-Q-Network-Navigation

<h1>Project 1: Navigation</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The purpose of this navigation project is to train an agent to navigate and collect bannanas in a large open square world</p>
      <p>Eachtime the agent collects a yellow banana the agent is rewarded with +1 reward, however, if a blue banana is picked up the agent then receives a score of -1.  Throughout this environment the goal of the game is to select a strategy that enables the agent to maximize the number of yellow bananas that it eats which minimizing the number of blue bananas that it stumbles across</p>
      <p>Overall, if each state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agents velocity, and the ray based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction.  During this time the agent must determine the best set of actions to take.  4 discrete actions that are available include the following</p>
      <ul>
        <li><s>0:</s> -move forward</li>
        <li><s>1:</s> -move backward</li>
        <li><s>2:</s> -turn left</li>
        <li><s>3:</s> -turn right</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To solve the environment an avg. score of over 13 in any 100 episode period</p>
