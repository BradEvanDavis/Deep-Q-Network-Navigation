<h1>Project 1: Navigation</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The purpose of this navigation project is to train an agent to navigate and collect bannanas in a large open square world</p>

      <p>Each time within this world that the agent collects a yellow banana the agent is rewarded with +1 reward, however, if a blue banana is picked up the agent then receives a score of -1.  Throughout this environment the goal of the game is to select a strategy that enables the agent to maximize the number of yellow bananas that it eats which minimizing the number of blue bananas that it stumbles across</p>
